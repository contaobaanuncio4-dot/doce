The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build is failing due to a module that could not be loaded during the build process. The error specifically points to a file `/client/src/lib/cep-api` that could not be loaded, which is imported by `/client/src/pages/checkout-simple-fi`.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the file `/client/src/lib/cep-api` exists and is committed to the repository.
2. Ensure that the file `/client/src/lib/cep-api` is correctly referenced in the `checkout-simple-fi` file.
3. If the file is correctly committed and referenced, consider adding `cep-api` to the `external` configuration in the build tool if it's not a typical JavaScript module. Make sure the package or file is present in the `package.json` file.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with the module loading during the build process.
