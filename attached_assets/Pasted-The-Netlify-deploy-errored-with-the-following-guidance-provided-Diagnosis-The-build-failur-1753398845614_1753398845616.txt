The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
The build failure is due to an error during the build process where Vite is unable to load a specific file, `client/src/components/image-skeleton`, which is imported by another file.

The relevant error lines are:
```
[vite:load-fallback] Could not load /opt/build/repo/client/src/components/image-skeleton (imported by client/src/components
error during build:
```

### Solution
1. **Check File Existence**: Verify that the file `client/src/components/image-skeleton` exists in the specified path and that it is committed to the repository.

2. **Updating Browserslist Data**: Update the Browserslist data by running the command suggested in the error message:
   ```bash
   npx update-browserslist-db@latest
   ```

3. **Resolve Dependency Loading Issue**: If the file `image-skeleton` is correctly present, ensure that it is properly imported in the component that is using it to avoid any import issues.

By following these steps, you should be able to address the build failure.
