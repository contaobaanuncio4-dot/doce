The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
The build is failing with an error message:
```
[vite:load-fallback] Could not load /opt/build/repo/client/src/components/image-skeleton (imported by client/src/components
```
This error indicates that Vite is unable to load the `image-skeleton` component during the build process.

### Solution
1. **Check file existence**: Verify that the `image-skeleton` component exists in the specified path `client/src/components/image-skeleton`.
2. **Commit the file**: Ensure the `image-skeleton` file is committed to the repository.
3. **Update import path**: If the file exists but the import path is incorrect, update the import path in the file where it is being imported from.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the error related to the `image-skeleton` component.
